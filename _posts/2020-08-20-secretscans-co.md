# Happiness

I'm glad that i joined to Secretscans.co, until now i learning a lot
from there. Meet some people that was nice. 

Currently i was TS-Student, and as TS it's a bit hard or no ? hehe.

I decided to learn about Cleaner / Redrawer and that's really hard.
I mean in some page, you really need have a skill not a beginner like me.
Oh yeah and i found good tools to redraw that was Spot Healing Brush,
whoever make it I'm proud of you :D 

The software i use is Photoshop, sometimes i use Krita.

# First Contact

I talk to one of the staff or perhaps the one who hold the "power" ?
and i decided to join secret scans since i don't get any answer 
from my previous local scans until now.

That way i become TS-Student based on my previous test on Kiryuu.co
