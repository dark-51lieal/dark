I have officially become Typesetter but yeah my shaping still bad, Friends are.....


My English ? Well, I know it isn't "good" but, have you got the point? That's what a language for.

I'm fully understand about TS-ing, it's not that hard if you work with some official scanlator (ex : mangatoon) because they are less care about shaping and font, the only problem i have is. When you do TS-ing SFX, you need to have a correct font, at least it look closely with the original SFX and I'm still strugling about Font. The rest is colouring and effect, sometimes i meet they have blur effects with gradient colour. it doesn't take time learning those effect.

I'm glad that i joined to Secretscans.co, until now i learning a lot

Currently i was TS-Student, and as TS it's a bit hard or no ? hehe.


I decided to learn about Cleaner / Redrawer and that's really hard.
I mean in some page, you really need have a skill not a beginner like me.
Oh yeah i found good tools to redraw that was Spot Healing Brush,

The software i use is Photoshop, sometimes i use Krita.
